# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This website was created using only HTML and CSS in order to be a place to show off Luke Antonello's work to potential employers. 

While the interface is basic it is functional. The top right navigation is used to show off the different elements of the site showcasing my usage of 'fancy buttons'. The site is also user-friendly for both mobile and desktop. I plan on adding more once I finish more projects.
